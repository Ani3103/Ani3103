Customer Churn Rate prediction:
Using Binary classification (2 target labels, Example: Yes/No) to determine the customer-churn rate on a product.

Following step are involved-
	Analyzing relevant features affecting customer retention (These are not significant to predict churn rate)
	Analyzing reviews and feedbacks
	Extracting features and Engineering new features
	Sigmoid or tanh activation for probability calculation
